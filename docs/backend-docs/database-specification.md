## Introduction

The document talks about the database schema and how things are connected. I will list all the fields in each model (table/object), and talk about the relationships it has with other model. 

I use Django ORM for the database accessing/writing. 

Some notations: `FK`: Foreign Key, `MTM`: Many To Many Relationship, `OTO`: One To One Relationship. 

## Mixins

I copied a description of mixins, but you can just skip it knowing that mixin is just a plugin enabling models having the mixin possess the same properties the mixin has. 

"In same cases different models could have same fields and same procedures in the product life cycle. To handle these similarities without having code repetition inheritance could be used. Instead of inheriting a whole class, mixin design pattern offers us to inherit (or some says include) some methods and attributes." 

* `UUIDMixin` 
    - `id`: The unique identifier of records. The value is generated by 
`uuid.uuid4` method in the native Python library. 
* `TimeDateMixin`
    - `created_time`: It automatically records the time at which a record is created. 
    - `modified_time`: It automatically records the time at which a record is modified. 
* `PublishedMixin`
    - `is_published`: A field indicating whether the record having this property should be displayed publicly. 

## `User`

* `UUIDMixin`
* `username`: The username of a user
* `email`: The email of a user
* `is_verified`: A field indicating whether this user passes email verification
* `role`: The role of this user, it can be either one of the following values: `Administrator`, `Author`, `Translator`, `Visitor`. 
* `date_joined`: The date on which this user is created 

## `Category`

* `UUIDMixin`
* `PublishedMixin`
* `category`: The category name 

## `Tutorial`

* `UUIDMixin`
* `TimeDateMixin`
* `PublishedMixin`
* `url`: The unique url of this tutorial. Users can access this tutorial by typing `https://domain-name.com/tutorial/url` in the browser to access this tutorial
* `name`: The unique human readable id of this tutorial 
* `categories` (MTM): This field links `Tutorial` with the `Category`

## `Graph`

* `UUIDMixin`
* `TimeDateMixin`
* `PublishedMixin`
* `url`: The unique url of this tutorial. Users can access the playground of this graph by typing `https://domain-name.com/graph/url` (format to be changed in future releases). 
* `name`: The unique human readable id of this graph
* `categories` (MTM): This field links `Graph` with the `Category`
* `authors` (MTM): This field links `Graph` with `User` 
* `priority`: The priority of this graph, it can be either one of the following values: `Main Graph`, `Supplement Graph`, and `Trivial Graph` 
* `tutorials` (MTM): This field links `Graph` with `Tutorial`

## `Code`

* `UUIDMixin`
* `TimeDateMixin`
* `tutorial` (OTO): This field links `Code` with `Tutorial`
* `code`: The actual content of the Python code

## `ExecResultJson`

* `UUIDMixin`
* `TimeDateMixin`
* `code` (FK): This field links `ExecResultJson` with `Code`
* `graph` (FK): This field links `ExecResultJson` with `Graph`
* `json`: The actual json content read by the frontend to update Cytoscape graphs and the editor highlighting. 

## `{LanguageCode}`

`{LanguageCode}` should be swapped by actual language code like `ENUS`, `ZHCN`, etc. The code should only contain uppercase letters. 

* `UUIDMixin`
* `TimeDateMixin`
* `PublishedMixin`
* `title`: The actual title that will be in different language and displayed on the website's title section. 
* `authors`: This link translations with `User`, stores the users who wrote/translate this tutorial.
* `tutorila_anchor` (OTO): This links translations with `Tutorial`. 
* `abstract`: The content of the abstract that will be displayed on the website's abstract section. 
* `content_md`: The markdown version of the tutorial text
* `content_html`: The html version of the tutorial text

## `{LanguageCode}GraphContent`

`{LanguageCode}` should be swapped by actual language code like `ENUS`, `ZHCN`, etc. The code should only contain uppercase letters. This kind of tables store the info of graphs in different translations. 

* `UUIDMixin`
* `TimeDateMixin`
* `PublishedMixin`
* `title`: The actual title that will be in different language and displayed on the website's title section. 
* `abstract`: The content of a short introduction of the graph
* `graph_anchor`: This link translations of graph content with `Graph`.
